# Embedded SPWM Generation using PIC18F4550

This project contains source code written by **Atri Datta** for generating Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) signals using the PIC18F4550 microcontroller. It utilizes software-based triangle comparison, a sine lookup table, and a Timer0 ISR for accurate waveform synthesis.

# Features

- 1000-point sine wave LUT (8-bit)
- Triangular carrier generation via software counter
- Center-aligned dual-edge modulation
- Timer0 interrupt-driven SPWM
- Designed for 20 MHz crystal
- Application: V/f control of 3-phase induction motors
